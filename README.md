Sometimes it's hard to make new friends. Small talk is super uncomfortable, like are we supposed to talk about the weather some more? Great the warm weather today feels great. Our job as developers is to make the hard parts of life easy. You're going to build a friend-screen process. Think of this as a "be my friend application".

You will be coding your solution in `js/get-to-know-you.js`. Your job is to use the `prompt` and `alert` functions to ask questions to your new friend. What type of interests is it important that your friends have? Think of the questions you want to ask your applicants for a new friend, and use the prompt method to ask the user questions and store their input in a variable.

Once you've taken in all the information, use the `alert` function to summarize their responses and print them back out in the user.

You can test your code by opening up `index.html` in the browser. You'll also want to make sure that `js/get-to-know-you.js` has been appropriately linked to `index.html`.
